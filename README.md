# Prolog Practice HUB

This repository is a compilation of `prolog` programs I did in a course during my computer science bachelor's degree at Avignon Universit√©.

## Use prolog

On `Ubuntu`, you can download `prolog` like this : 
```bash
sudo apt-get install swi-prolog
```

On `Windows`, you can check out the [swi-prolog website](https://www.swi-prolog.org/windows.html).
